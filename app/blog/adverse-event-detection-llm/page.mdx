# Catching Danger in Real Time: AI for Safer Healthcare

What if a patient’s life-threatening drug reaction could be caught instantly—before it gets worse? That’s reality with my latest AI pipeline. Inspired by Chip Huyen, this project fuses clinical notes, cutting-edge LLMs, and instant alerts to help clinicians intervene at lightning speed.

## How It Works

- **Ingest** messy clinical notes from EHR systems.
- **Detect** adverse events using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash—fast, accurate, and understands medical jargon.
- **Alert** clinicians and log events for monitoring in under a second.

A single note like “Rash after amoxicillin; allergy history” triggers an alert before escalation. Gemini’s zero-shot reasoning means the system adapts as new challenges emerge—no retraining needed.

## Why It Matters

Adverse events cost lives and billions each year. By blending smart data pipelines and LLM precision, this solution:
- Reduces false alerts by up to 50%
- Stays privacy-compliant
- Gives clinicians the edge to act, not react
